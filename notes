TODO:

- Make it possible to flag all areas to "ON" by editing model run config creation
- Fix how area key is passed into isolate_by_proportion on layer creation

- Develop caching for shp_files and generated data (demand values, coverage)
- Automate output styling (with configurable tags for different style groups eg style='Brave_Original')

- DL OSM data for Columbus and align it
- Create a routable network from OSM data
- Use resources to create isochrones based on the routable network for each point instead of buffers

- Use rudimentary elimination of the responders who cover the least area to reduce responders until threshold is hit when combining areas

- Add census block data to blocks file for race, age, income

TODO: (Popmodels)
- Confirm that you are using the census block IDs in a proper / unique way
- Add location information to each person (random point within their assigned block)
- Use naive bayes to generate a likelihood that a person will overdose based on ER visits / ambulance calls
- Add a function to population / subpopulation to make a shp file from members
- Collapse block data to the block level
- Fix person.to_list to return a flat list
- Create a set of submodels for all blocks and store them in a population
- Make attribute generators take a baseline or fill function to be used when a distribution can't be generated
